# SmileSchool – HTML Advanced Project

This project is part of a Holberton Web Development Course.  
The goal is to recreate a webpage structure from a Figma design, focusing exclusively on HTML semantics (For now).

## Objectives

- Reproduce the **SmileSchool** homepage layout as shown in a given Figma file.
- Write **pure HTML**, no external frameworks or libraries.
- Pass validation through the **W3C HTML Validator**.

## Structure

All image files are stored inside the `images/` folder.

1. **Header**

   - Contains the site logo and three navigation links (`Courses`, `Pricing`, `Login`).

2. **Banner (Hero)**

   - Includes a title, short text, and a button.
   - Followed by a list of four “pros” each with an image, name, and subtitle.

3. **Quote Section**

   - Contains an image and a testimonial block with quote, author, and subtitle.

4. **Videos Section**

   - A heading plus four tutorial blocks (each includes image, title, text, author, rating stars, and duration).

5. **Membership Section**

   - A title, four benefit blocks, and a “Register for free” button.

6. **FAQ Section**

   - Title followed by two “rows” of two question/answer pairs each.

7. **Footer**
   - Contains a logo, three linked social media icons, and a copyright text.

## Notes

- As it is mentioned before, There is **no CSS or styling** applied yet in this Project.
- **Some references (links)** are empty (`#` as href) because the Figma example shows a single-page design, no additional pages were created or linked.
- The file names and image references follow the Figma assets used in the design.

## Tools Used

- **VS Code** for writing and testing HTML locally.
- **W3C Validator** for syntax and compliance checks.
- **Figma** for inspecting layout structure and hierarchy.

All code and structure replicate the original Figma design as closely as possible.
